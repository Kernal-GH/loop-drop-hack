Loop Drop HACK EDITION
===

This is a fork of [mmckegg/loop-drop-app](https://github.com/mmckegg/loop-drop-app) that we did for WellyHack (19 July 2014). We were attempting to add multiplayer support in conjunction with [mmckegg/loop-drop-server](https://github.com/mmckegg/loop-drop-server).

The idea being that people from around the world can all collaborate and jam together using the Loop Drop loop style. Everyone would contribute their own soundbank and be able to hear everyone else's soundbank playing the current loop.

We managed to get it working well enough for the demo, but a lot of work still needs to be done to share audio content (such as one-shot samples), better clock sync (maybe NTP style). Would be nice to display the connected users better with an audio meter next to each user.
